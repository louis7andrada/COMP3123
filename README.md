# React-Redux JWT Demo Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This project is a simple React application that demonstrates the integration of Redux for state management and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. It features a basic login system where the user's authentication state is managed via Redux, and a JWT is used to simulate maintaining a user session.

## Installation
### `npm start`

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

Enter a username and password in the login form.
Click the 'Login' button to simulate the authentication process.
Upon successful login, a welcome message will be displayed, and the user's login state is managed using Redux.

## Features
- User Authentication: Simulates user login with a static username and password.
- Redux State Management: Utilizes Redux for managing the authentication state across the application.
- JWT Simulation: Demonstrates the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in handling user sessions. (Note: This demo uses a hardcoded fake JWT for demonstration purposes).
- React Components: Showcases the use of functional React components and hooks.
